## What about WireGuard?
ForNet is based on [BoringTun](https://github.com/cloudflare/boringtun) which is the Rust implementation of WireGuard. We very appreciate their efforts to create such brilliant project.
In future develop plan, we would support WireGuard original client.
## What about backend?
Backend server web framework is used with [Scalatra](https://scalatra.org/), written in Scala 3, It provides Http Restful API with admin web, and handle mqtt callback requests.
MQTT is used with the Rust implementation: [RMQTT](https://github.com/rmqtt/rmqtt),it support MQTT v3.1 and V5.0, we use it to sync config and changes to client.
